# Student Grade Tracker - Python Project

## Overview

This Python project is a **Student Grade Tracker** designed to help manage and track student grades across multiple subjects or assignments. The system allows users to input grades, calculate the average score, and display a detailed grade report, including the corresponding letter grade and GPA (on a 4.0 scale).

### Features:
- **Grade Input**: Users can input grades for various subjects or assignments.
- **Average Calculation**: The program calculates the average of all entered grades.
- **Letter Grade Assignment**: Based on the average, the program assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).
- **GPA Calculation**: The program calculates the GPA based on the average grade (on a 4.0 scale).
- **Grade Report**: Displays a complete report with individual subject grades, average score, letter grade, and GPA.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Core language for the application.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Used for organizing the code and managing student grades efficiently.

### How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the `student_grades.py` file.
3. Input grades for different subjects when prompted.
4. View the grade report that includes the calculated average, letter grade, and GPA.

### Example:
```bash
Enter subject name (or type 'done' to finish): Math
Enter grade for Math: 85
Enter subject name (or type 'done' to finish): Science
Enter grade for Science: 90
Enter subject name (or type 'done' to finish): done
```

The program will output:
```
Grade Report:
--------------
Math: 85.0
Science: 90.0

Average Grade: 87.5
Letter Grade: B
GPA: 3.0
```
